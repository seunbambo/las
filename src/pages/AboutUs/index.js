              The philosophy of Lasretrad is that property Seekerâ€™s should be
              provided with necessary information needed to make right decision.
              Such information must be clear, fair and not misleading. Also,
              such prospective clients have the right to expect that any
              professional advice received is appropriate for his/her individual
              circumstance. In essence, the true condition of the property must
              be disclosed. See article 3-9 of the Primary Duty to Client, under
              licensed Estate Agents Code of Conduct.{" "}
